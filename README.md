# Image Classifier

This project was created as a final project of Udacity Nanodegree " AI Programming with Python". The project is divided into two parts. The first one is a Jupyter Notebook, where I implemented an image classifier with PyTorch. The second one is based on the first one, but is convert into an application, so you can run it from the command line.
